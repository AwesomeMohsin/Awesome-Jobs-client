## Project Features

- Multiple Sign-In Options with JWT Security: Our project offers various sign-in methods, allowing users to create accounts and log in with their email and password or conveniently through their Google accounts. User sessions are secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- Categorized Job Listings: We've categorized job listings into different types, making it effortless for users to explore and filter job opportunities using categorized tabs for an enhanced user experience.

- Comprehensive Job Listings View: Within the "All Jobs" section, users have access to a comprehensive list of all available job opportunities. Users can explore job listings with detailed information and access a "Details" button for each job. This feature offers users an extensive view of the available job market.

- Efficient Job Search: Users can easily search for specific job listings by title, streamlining their job-hunting process. This search functionality provides a quick and convenient way for users to find job opportunities that match their interests and skills.

- Streamlined Job Application Process: Users can easily apply for jobs directly from the job details page. Our system intelligently prevents users from applying for positions once the application deadline has passed or if they are the job poster.

- Application Tracking: Our project provides users with a dedicated section for monitoring their job applications, ensuring they can stay organized and informed about their application status.

- User-Generated Job Listings: Users have the power to add new job listings, enabling them to post fresh job opportunities for others to view and apply to.

- Personalized Job Management: Users can access their own job listings within the "My Jobs" section. Importantly, our system enforces strict data privacy, ensuring users can only view the jobs they've added and not those posted by others.

- Job Listing Updates: Users can effortlessly edit and revise the job listings they've added, ensuring their job postings remain accurate and current.
